Although Java today is still [the most used programming language in the world](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index) and this should allow me to find works for other few years is always better to know the alternatives, especially if they are amazing alternatives like **Node.js**.

Node.js is a javascript framework which is focused on backend programming. The applications run on the backend relying on the google chrome [V8 engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)).

With Node.js developers can 
1 use the same programming language and debugging/building tools both on frontend and backend
2 develop backend application using an asynchronous paradigm

The point 1 is for sure an interesting **Pros** the point 2 sometime is, sometime not, depends on what you have to do.

Long story short, let's go to see which components can be used in the Node.js world as **runtime**, **build tool**, **REST framework**, **logging system** to build the most straighforward web application: a contact form hosted on the github pages.
